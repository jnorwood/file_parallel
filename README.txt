copy_parallel.d and rmdir_parallel.d provide parallel implementations of file system operations to copy 
and remove files or directories.

There are a couple of example commandline usages, rmd_main.d and cpd_main.d, in file_parallel/examples.
These also provide example usage of wildArgvs, from file_utils/argv_expand.d, to provide simple argv
wildcard expansion for Windows.
